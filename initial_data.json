Workshops for advanced study abroad faculty were conducted at VASI (Vietnamese Advanced Summer Institute) located at the Hanoi University of Foreign Studies; COTIM (Consortium for the Teaching of Indonesian and Malay) located at Universitas Sam Ratulangi in Manado, Sulawesi, Indonesia; and ASK (Advanced Study of Khmer) located at Royal University of Phnom Penh (Cambodia). VASI and COTIM have enjoyed long support from the US Department of Education Fulbright Foreign Language and Area Studies (FLAS) Fellowship Program. ASK, a younger, smaller program, enjoys limited support from the UH Center for Southeast Asian Studies (CSEAS). This document reports on these activities. \nA series of teacher training workshops will be conducted for faculty teaching at advanced study abroad programs in Southeast Asia. Workshops are being planned for Filipino, Indonesian, Khmer, Thai, and\nVietnamese. Training may also be conducted at the Southeast Asian Studies Summer Institute at the University of Wisconsin."

In October 2010 the NFLRC will convene an international CMC (computer mediated communication) Symposium in which the four culture caf?s, and the exchanges which have taken place in them over the intervening year, will be showcased.\nOn-line caf?s will be created in four target languages using BRIX courseware, a dynamic Web courseware system featuring a 3-tier client/server model using on-line database connectivity and employing widely available Web technologies including client-side scripting and streaming media. Members of each caf? will dialogue on line with peers and facilitators (instructors) in a learning community via forums or threaded discussions. The caf?s will feature a social area for free chat, a discussion area for instructor-guided interaction, a grammar clinic for focus on form, and a gallery for sharing pictures of school and community as well as other graphics. The four caf?s will each have a distinct sub-theme.\n\nFilipino Community Caf?. Advanced Filipino language students at UH will meet Filipino heritage students in the University of California system in an on-line Community Caf?. UC participation will be coordinated through the office of the Consortium for Language Learning and Teaching at UC Davis. The Community Caf? will create a venue for students to share ideas and experiences on outreach initiatives in local communities in Hawaii and California.\n\nJapanese Culture Caf?. Advanced Japanese language students at Aiea High School in Honolulu will meet English language students at Tezukayama Gakuin Izumigaoka High School in Osaka, Japan, in an on-line Culture Caf?. The caf? format will be based on the well-regarded Cultura model based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. This project allows students not only to improve their target language skills but also to compare and contrast their cultural values with the values of the target culture participants.\n\nSamoan Pathways Caf?. Advanced Samoan language students at UH will meet Samoan language students at American Samoa Community College in Pago Pago and Samoan language students at Farrington High School in Honolulu in an on-line Pathways Caf?. The content focus of the Pathways Caf? will be to facilitate articulation from high school and community college to university. Samoan heritage students are significantly underrepresented at institutions of higher education in the US, and this caf? project is intended to \"demystify\" the university experience for high school and community college students by allowing them to be exposed to and mentored by successful Samoan language students at UH, with the heritage language as a focus of interchange.\n\nChina-USA Business Caf?. Adapting to the culture of one's language of study is a critical ingredient for successful functioning in the target culture environment. This is doubly true in the world of business, which is governed by culturally specific protocols. In the China-USA Business Caf?, Chinese students of business English in the US International MBA Program (USIMBA) at Guangzhou's Sun Yat-Sen University will meet online with American students of business Chinese in the UH Shidler College of Business' China International MBA Program (CIMBA) in preparation for and during their study abroad programs at each others' universities. Using techniques developed in the the acclaimed Cultura model, students will engage in discussion about similarities and differences in cultural values and practices in the world of business in China and in the USA.

Recasts are defined as responses by an interlocutor which add morphosyntactic information to a learner's utterance without changing its essential\nmeaning. Models, on the other hand, provide target-like input before the learner has attempted to produce at all. In this project, learners engaged in various communication games with differential treatment provided on two target language structures. The research was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Do adult learners benefit incidentally from recasts or other forms of implicit, \"off-record\" negative evidence when they encounter them in spontaneous conversation unaccompanied by metalinguistic explanation?; (2) Are recasts more effective than models in fostering interlanguage development? Should it be found that adults learning a foreign or second language do in fact benefit from recasts in the way first language acquisition researchers have found that children can, the implications for classroom language teaching methodology would be substantial. In addition to producing changes in traditional foreign\nlanguage and ESL teaching, use of tasks with recasts might be one of the easiest ways to facilitate a learner's focus on form without losing sight of a lesson's (or conversation's) predominant focus on meaning.</P>\n\n<P>Studies were completed focusing on the learning of Spanish and Japanese as foreign languages.

Recasts are defined as responses by an interlocutor which add morphosyntactic information to a learner's utterance without changing its essential\nmeaning. Models, on the other hand, provide target-like input before the learner has attempted to produce at all. In this project, learners engaged in various communication games with differential treatment provided on two target language structures. The research was designed to answer the following questions: (1) Do adult learners benefit incidentally from recasts or other forms of implicit, \"off-record\" negative evidence when they encounter them in spontaneous conversation unaccompanied by metalinguistic explanation?; (2) Are recasts more effective than models in fostering interlanguage development? Should it be found that adults learning a foreign or second language do in fact benefit from recasts in the way first language acquisition researchers have found that children can, the implications for classroom language teaching methodology would be substantial. In addition to producing changes in traditional foreign\nlanguage and ESL teaching, use of tasks with recasts might be one of the easiest ways to facilitate a learner's focus on form without losing sight of a lesson's (or conversation's) predominant focus on meaning.</P>\n\n<P>Studies were completed focusing on the learning of Spanish and Japanese as foreign languages.

For most beginning level students, CATRC takes between 5 and 15 minutes. On average, intermediate students spend about 30 minutes on the test. Most advanced and superior students can finish the test in an hour, but a few might take up to two hours. We will also write and test approximately 40 new items per semester to add to the CATRC test bank (currently at 445 items).</P>\n\n<P><B>Writing</B></P>\n\n<P>We have developed a battery of 85 graded writing tasks in Mandarin Chinese, ranging from Novice (\"Fill in your name, nationality, age, gender... on this form\") through Intermediate (\"Write a note to X, suggesting that s/he meet you for lunch tomorrow. Specify time and place\") and Advanced (\"Write a paragraph from a letter to a friend, comparing your home town with another city you have visited recently. Give details\") to Superior (\"Write a paragraph explaining the US position on human rights in China\"). These 85 writing tasks were\ndistributed into 5 forms of the test, which will be administered to students in Chinese language classes near the end of the Spring semester in 1998. Concurrently, we will devise a way to administer the test by computer, with student responses being recorded on paper and scored manually.</P>\n\n<P><B>Speaking</B></P>\n\n<P>The Visual-Oral Communicative Instrument (VOCI) in Mandarin Chinese was co-authored by Hawai\u2018i's Cynthia Ning for the San Diego State University NFLRC. This is a simulated OPI interview administered by videotape, with the student's responses recorded on audio tape. It is estimated that a Novice/Intermediate student would complete this test in approximately 15 minutes, while an Advanced/Superior student would take up to 25 minutes. A rater then\nlistens to the audio tapes at leisure and provides an approximate rating of speaking proficiency. In most cases, VOCI ratings are likely to be exact enough to place students, but in individual cases where VOCI results might prove misleading or inconclusive, the program can retest the students through a regular OPI.</P>\n\n<P><B>Listening</B></P>\n\n<P>Prof. Chuanren Ke of the NFLRC at the Iowa State University is currently working on a computer-adaptive test of listening comprehension in Mandarin Chinese.

For most beginning level students, CATRC takes between 5 and 15 minutes. On average, intermediate students spend about 30 minutes on the test. Most advanced and superior students can finish the test in an hour, but a few might take up to two hours. We will also write and test approximately 40 new items per semester to add to the CATRC test bank (currently at 445 items).</P>\n\n<P><B>Writing</B></P>\n\n<P>We have developed a battery of 85 graded writing tasks in Mandarin Chinese, ranging from Novice (\"Fill in your name, nationality, age, gender... on this form\") through Intermediate (\"Write a note to X, suggesting that s/he meet you for lunch tomorrow. Specify time and place\") and Advanced (\"Write a paragraph from a letter to a friend, comparing your home town with another city you have visited recently. Give details\") to Superior (\"Write a paragraph explaining the US position on human rights in China\"). These 85 writing tasks were\ndistributed into 5 forms of the test, which will be administered to students in Chinese language classes near the end of the Spring semester in 1998. Concurrently, we will devise a way to administer the test by computer, with student responses being recorded on paper and scored manually.</P>\n\n<P><B>Speaking</B></P>\n\n<P>The Visual-Oral Communicative Instrument (VOCI) in Mandarin Chinese was co-authored by Hawai\u2018i's Cynthia Ning for the San Diego State University NFLRC. This is a simulated OPI interview administered by videotape, with the student's responses recorded on audio tape. It is estimated that a Novice/Intermediate student would complete this test in approximately 15 minutes, while an Advanced/Superior student would take up to 25 minutes. A rater then\nlistens to the audio tapes at leisure and provides an approximate rating of speaking proficiency. In most cases, VOCI ratings are likely to be exact enough to place students, but in individual cases where VOCI results might prove misleading or inconclusive, the program can retest the students through a regular OPI.</P>\n\n<P><B>Listening</B></P>\n\n<P>Prof. Chuanren Ke of the NFLRC at the Iowa State University is currently working on a computer-adaptive test of listening comprehension in Mandarin Chinese. We are in contact with him, and as soon as a field test version is available, we will include this instrument as well in the testing line-up. We propose to test all incoming students using the instruments listed above. Placement into the four core levels of Mandarin training will be on the basis of the following schedule (proficiency levels are stated for listening, speaking, and reading only; it is expected that students' writing ability will be lower):</P>\n\n<P><CENTER><TABLE >\n<TR>\n<TD align=CENTER WIDTH=133 HEIGHT=22>\n\n</TD><TD align=CENTER WIDTH=122 HEIGHT=22>\n<B>Prerequisite level</B></td></tr></table></p>\n\nSSVLT all",

        "description": "<P><B>Rationale and Objectives:</B></P>\n\n<P>United States educational policies and public attitudes have often reflected a narrow view of language needs and rights. The purpose of the Foreign Language Partnership (FLPP) was to begin to counteract prevailing \"English Only\" attitudes by facilitating language acquisition among university students learning foreign languages while maintaining native language and raising self-esteem among immigrants. A pilot version of the FLPP at the University of Hawai\u2018i was funded for two years by the NFLRC. The purposes of the project were three-fold: 1) to address the low academic achievement among historically under-served minority students; 2) to address low oral and literacy proficiency among university level foreign language learners; and 3) to address national needs for a bilingual work force\nfor international business purposes.</P>\n\n<P><B>Implementation:</B></P>\n\n<P>\"At risk\" high school students who are native speakers of less commonly-taught languages were hired and trained to provide tutoring for university foreign language students, focusing on communicative language use. The at-risk high school students supplemented and\nenriched the foreign language instruction the University provides by providing one-on-one and small group tutoring (at no cost to the university students), as well as occasional target language experiences such as immigrant community/family events. In the 1994-95 academic year, five native speakers of Ilokano and Tagalog from a Honolulu area high school tutored five university students; in the 1995-96 academic year, four native speakers of Ilokano and two Samoan native speakers from the same school tutored eleven university students. The high school tutors participated in a training course covering sociolinguistic and tutoring strategies prior to beginning their work. The demand for tutoring was overwhelming and only a small\nfraction of interested university students could be accommodated. In addition, other high school students have expressed interest in teaching their languages to university students. Clearly this program is filling a need on both sides. The sessions generally lasted from\nan hour to an hour and a half, and consisted of working on the university students' homework as well as other, more communicative and culturally relevant activities. These activities including dancing (the Samoan groups) and talking about cultural activities such as holidays. Several times groups sought out situations in which they would use the target language, as when they went to Filipino restaurants and ordered food using Tagalog. Finally, participants\noften used the time to gossip in the target language or a mixture of the target language and English.</P>\n\n<P><B>Results:</B></P>\n\n<P>One of the benefits of the program was that the tutors' language skills increased, in both their own language and in English.

The purpose of the Foreign Language Partnership (FLPP) was to begin to counteract prevailing \"English Only\" attitudes by facilitating language acquisition among university students learning foreign languages while maintaining native language and raising self-esteem among immigrants. A pilot version of the FLPP at the University of Hawai\u2018i was funded for two years by the NFLRC. The purposes of the project were three-fold: 1) to address the low academic achievement among historically under-served minority students; 2) to address low oral and literacy proficiency among university level foreign language learners; and 3) to address national needs for a bilingual work force\nfor international business purposes.\n\nImplementation:\n\n\"At risk\" high school students who are native speakers of less commonly-taught languages were hired and trained to provide tutoring for university foreign language students, focusing on communicative language use. The at-risk high school students supplemented and\nenriched the foreign language instruction the University provides by providing one-on-one and small group tutoring (at no cost to the university students), as well as occasional target language experiences such as immigrant community/family events. In the 1994-95 academic year, five native speakers of Ilokano and Tagalog from a Honolulu area high school tutored five university students; in the 1995-96 academic year, four native speakers of Ilokano and two Samoan native speakers from the same school tutored eleven university students. The high school tutors participated in a training course covering sociolinguistic and tutoring strategies prior to beginning their work. The demand for tutoring was overwhelming and only a small\nfraction of interested university students could be accommodated. In addition, other high school students have expressed interest in teaching their languages to university students. Clearly this program is filling a need on both sides. The sessions generally lasted from\nan hour to an hour and a half, and consisted of working on the university students' homework as well as other, more communicative and culturally relevant activities. These activities including dancing (the Samoan groups) and talking about cultural activities such as holidays. Several times groups sought out situations in which they would use the target language, as when they went to Filipino restaurants and ordered food using Tagalog. Finally, participants\noften used the time to gossip in the target language or a mixture of the target language and English.\n\nResults:\n\nOne of the benefits of the program was that the tutors' language skills increased, in both their own language and in English. In the case of their native language, tutors developed metalinguistic awareness, grammar rules, and the semantics of the language. In the case of English, they became more confident, acquired new vocabulary, and generally developed their fluency. The tutors were able to maintain good grades in high school while they worked in the program, and although several of them had already some college plans, they gained more confidence in their ability to attend and succeed in college. They also felt that they became more responsible and mature due to the nature of the job.

The project's overall goal is two-pronged: improving the teaching of a particular foreign language, Indonesian, and developing approaches to the classroom learning of pragmatics which are applicable to other target languages as well. Indonesian is identified as the target language for this project because there are existing teaching materials which, although not primarily pragmatic in focus, the\nproject can build on, and because Indonesian is a typical foreign language in Hawai\u2018i, affording students little contact with the language outside the classroom. Hence, we will be able to assess the effectiveness of various instructional measures in an authentic yet laboratory-type setting, in so far as uncontrolled learning outside the classroom will be minimized.</P>\n\n<P>Materials will include written texts and videos of relevant interactions in target contexts. Activities will include small group in-class tasks and role-plays supported by the videotaped and written materials, guided observations of videos and films outside class, and\nvarious forms of electronic communication (webchat, email) that can be used both inside and outside of class sessions. Teaching strategies will include implicit and explicit ways of teaching different aspects of Indonesian pragmatics, such as input enhancement, input flood, awareness raising, and metapragmatic explanation and discussion. The project aims at developing and piloting these types of materials, activities, and teaching approaches in order to assess which of them are most effective for different pragmatic aspects of IFL and students at different proficiency levels.</P>\n\n<P>The project will consist of the following components:</P>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>Collection of videotaped material of authentic interactions,\nin Indonesia, between native and nonnative speakers of Indonesian\nand between Indonesian native speakers. The collection of these\ntwo sets of material is necessary in order to identify the\nadjustments Indonesians make when talking to foreigners and to\nincorporate such adjustments in material for beginning learners.\nFor more advanced learners, on the other hand, unadjusted native\nspeaker input is required. As has been amply documented in the\nliterature, target language input must be based on authentic data\nbecause even native speakers have little conscious awareness of\nthe sociolinguistic, pragmatic, and discourse features that they\nregularly use. Pragmatic aspects to focus on will include\ngreetings and terms of address; further aspects will be identified\nthrough the ongoing needs analysis.\n\n<LI>Trial runs of use of video and electronic communication\nincorporating pragmatic aspects. This is primarily for\ntrouble-shooting purposes and will take place in small groups\ninside and outside of IFL classes.\n\n<LI>Development of materials, activities, and teaching strategies.\nHow teaching approaches based on the Focus on Form principle\n(Doughty & Williams, 1998) can be transferred from the\nteaching of grammar to the teaching of pragmatics will be\nexplored.\n\n<LI>First and second year IFL classes at the University of Hawai\u2018i\nwill participate in the project for the duration of the entire\nproject. This extended period of observation and intervention will\nafford us the possibility of exploring teaching approaches\neffective for students at different levels of proficiency.\nAdopting a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional design\naffords better insights into students' progress and decreases\nuncontrollable variation between groups to some extent. Students'\npragmatic ability will be assessed prior to instruction.

The project's overall goal is two-pronged: improving the teaching of a particular foreign language, Indonesian, and developing approaches to the classroom learning of pragmatics which are applicable to other target languages as well. Indonesian is identified as the target language for this project because there are existing teaching materials which, although not primarily pragmatic in focus, the\nproject can build on, and because Indonesian is a typical foreign language in Hawai\u2018i, affording students little contact with the language outside the classroom. Hence, we will be able to assess the effectiveness of various instructional measures in an authentic yet laboratory-type setting, in so far as uncontrolled learning outside the classroom will be minimized.</P>\n\n<P>Materials will include written texts and videos of relevant interactions in target contexts. Activities will include small group in-class tasks and role-plays supported by the videotaped and written materials, guided observations of videos and films outside class, and\nvarious forms of electronic communication (webchat, email) that can be used both inside and outside of class sessions. Teaching strategies will include implicit and explicit ways of teaching different aspects of Indonesian pragmatics, such as input enhancement, input flood, awareness raising, and metapragmatic explanation and discussion. The project aims at developing and piloting these types of materials, activities, and teaching approaches in order to assess which of them are most effective for different pragmatic aspects of IFL and students at different proficiency levels.</P>\n\n<P>The project will consist of the following components:</P>\n\n<UL>\n<LI>Collection of videotaped material of authentic interactions,\nin Indonesia, between native and nonnative speakers of Indonesian\nand between Indonesian native speakers. The collection of these\ntwo sets of material is necessary in order to identify the\nadjustments Indonesians make when talking to foreigners and to\nincorporate such adjustments in material for beginning learners.\nFor more advanced learners, on the other hand, unadjusted native\nspeaker input is required. As has been amply documented in the\nliterature, target language input must be based on authentic data\nbecause even native speakers have little conscious awareness of\nthe sociolinguistic, pragmatic, and discourse features that they\nregularly use. Pragmatic aspects to focus on will include\ngreetings and terms of address; further aspects will be identified\nthrough the ongoing needs analysis.\n\n<LI>Trial runs of use of video and electronic communication\nincorporating pragmatic aspects. This is primarily for\ntrouble-shooting purposes and will take place in small groups\ninside and outside of IFL classes.\n\n<LI>Development of materials, activities, and teaching strategies.\nHow teaching approaches based on the Focus on Form principle\n(Doughty & Williams, 1998) can be transferred from the\nteaching of grammar to the teaching of pragmatics will be\nexplored.\n\n<LI>First and second year IFL classes at the University of Hawai\u2018i\nwill participate in the project for the duration of the entire\nproject. This extended period of observation and intervention will\nafford us the possibility of exploring teaching approaches\neffective for students at different levels of proficiency.\nAdopting a combined longitudinal and cross-sectional design\naffords better insights into students' progress and decreases\nuncontrollable variation between groups to some extent. Students'\npragmatic ability will be assessed prior to instruction. During\ninstruction, participant and non-participant observation will be\nconducted and smaller assessment activities will be car\nLLRNG PRGMT all",

Dr. Gregory Mark,\nprofessor of \"Chinese in Hawai\u2018i\" (Ethnic Studies 331), requires the Ethnic Studies service learning students to interview their tutees and establish personal relationships with them to enhance the heritage aspect of the service learning experience. By coordinating\nEthnic Studies 331 with a special section of Mandarin 202, participating students will be able to conduct their tutee interviews in the target language. Additionally, the Mandarin 202 students will be required to carry out Web-based, multimedia projects based on their service learning experience. By facilitating interviews in the field and requiring a multimedia Web-based project, the Mandarin 202 class will ensure that the four-skills, speaking, listening, reading, writing, are developed.

        "description": "Readily available collections of written or spoken language and easy-to-use analytical tools offer exciting possibilities for using the techniques of corpus linguistics to improve language teaching and learning. This project focuses on Korean, for which there has been explosive growth in corpora and software but no prior work on pedagogical corpus linguistics. Products will include a volume of studies applying corpus linguistics to problems in Korean language teaching and learning and a technical report on the uses of language corpora in teaching foreign languages in general.\n<p>\nFor a more in-depth description of this project, go to <A HREF=\"http://www.nflrc.hawaii.edu/project/2006EmoreInfo.html\">nflrc.hawaii.edu/project/2006EmoreInfo.html</a>.\n</p>\n<!--Corpus linguistics studies take advantage of the existence of large collections of language production (written or spoken language) in order to investigate a language. It bases its descriptions on the empirical characteristics of language production (rather than chiefly on theory, or speaker intuition). The past decade, and especially the past several years, have seen an explosion in corpus linguistic studies. This is due to several causes: first, personal computers now have the speed and storage capacity to process huge corpora (often involving tens or hundreds of millions of words \u2014 the equivalent of hundreds or thousands of thousand-page books) in a few seconds. If one wants to find out how a word is used, for example, one can pull up hundreds of examples, in context, in a matter of seconds in a convenient display using readily available and inexpensive tools. Second, there now exist easily accessible and scientifically prepared collections of language \u2014 large and well-structured corpora \u2014 which the individual can easily use on a personal computer. Third, the World Wide Web itself now contains an enormous amount of language, again readily accessible to the individual user. The Web has also made the distribution of scientific corpora and corpus tools easy and convenient, as well as provided a forum for corpus linguists to interact \u2014 thus driving the field forward. Fourth, the field of natural language processing by computer (and artificial intelligence in general) has been exploring the ways in which probabilistic models can improve processing: these probabilistic models require tools that investigate the statistical structure of language output, and this of course involves corpus studies.\n<P></p>\nForeign language pedagogy is now beginning to see new possibilities for recent advances in corpus linguistics to improve language teaching and learning. To be sure, the results of older \"classic\" corpus-based studies of word frequency have long been of interest to language teaching, informing decisions about materials development, grading of materials, and assessment. These early studies, from the period before the mid\u20131990s, were produced by specialists working with mainframe computers at major universities and research institutes. Certainly, corpus linguistics was nothing that an ordinary classroom teacher or learner could possibly do. What we are seeing now is something quite different and potentially revolutionary. Readily available corpora and easy-to-use tools can now be used on the spot in a language teaching context, by teachers and learners without extensive training in computational linguistics, and studies of linguistic features can be tailored to specific pedagogic context and learning requirements. Thus corpus linguistics fits in with the current emphasis on authentic materials and on task-based language teaching \u2014 emphases of other Hawai\u2018i NFLRC projects.\n<P></p>\nThis NFLRC project, to be accomplished during the first two years of the grant cycle, will have limited aims. We will not attempt to develop either corpora or corpus-analytic tools. Both of these are expensive and time-consuming endeavors which would require substantial funding from additional sources",

This project focuses on Korean, for which there has been explosive growth in corpora and software but no prior work on pedagogical corpus linguistics. Products will include a volume of studies applying corpus linguistics to problems in Korean language teaching and learning and a technical report on the uses of language corpora in teaching foreign languages in general.\n\n\nCorpus linguistics studies take advantage of the existence of large collections of language production (written or spoken language) in order to investigate a language. It bases its descriptions on the empirical characteristics of language production (rather than chiefly on theory, or speaker intuition). The past decade, and especially the past several years, have seen an explosion in corpus linguistic studies. This is due to several causes: first, personal computers now have the speed and storage capacity to process huge corpora (often involving tens or hundreds of millions of words \u2014 the equivalent of hundreds or thousands of thousand-page books) in a few seconds. If one wants to find out how a word is used, for example, one can pull up hundreds of examples, in context, in a matter of seconds in a convenient display using readily available and inexpensive tools. Second, there now exist easily accessible and scientifically prepared collections of language \u2014 large and well-structured corpora \u2014 which the individual can easily use on a personal computer. Third, the World Wide Web itself now contains an enormous amount of language, again readily accessible to the individual user. The Web has also made the distribution of scientific corpora and corpus tools easy and convenient, as well as provided a forum for corpus linguists to interact \u2014 thus driving the field forward. Fourth, the field of natural language processing by computer (and artificial intelligence in general) has been exploring the ways in which probabilistic models can improve processing: these probabilistic models require tools that investigate the statistical structure of language output, and this of course involves corpus studies.\nForeign language pedagogy is now beginning to see new possibilities for recent advances in corpus linguistics to improve language teaching and learning. To be sure, the results of older \"classic\" corpus-based studies of word frequency have long been of interest to language teaching, informing decisions about materials development, grading of materials, and assessment. These early studies, from the period before the mid\u20131990s, were produced by specialists working with mainframe computers at major universities and research institutes. Certainly, corpus linguistics was nothing that an ordinary classroom teacher or learner could possibly do. What we are seeing now is something quite different and potentially revolutionary. Readily available corpora and easy-to-use tools can now be used on the spot in a language teaching context, by teachers and learners without extensive training in computational linguistics, and studies of linguistic features can be tailored to specific pedagogic context and learning requirements. Thus corpus linguistics fits in with the current emphasis on authentic materials and on task-based language teaching \u2014 emphases of other Hawai\u2018i NFLRC projects.\nThis NFLRC project, to be accomplished during the first two years of the grant cycle, will have limited aims. We will not attempt to develop either corpora or corpus-analytic tools. Both of these are expensive and time-consuming endeavors which would require substantial funding from additional sources (however, such corpora and corpus tools are being developed at a rapid rate for many languages). Rather, the goal of this project is to demonstrate the potential of corpus based studies for foreign  LLRNG all",

The journal moved to Hawai\u2018i in 2002 under the co-editorship of Richard R. Day and Thom Hudson and Reviews Editor Anne Burns, Macquarie University, Australia.\n\nReading in a Foreign Language has established itself as an excellent source for the latest developments in the field, both theoretical and pedagogic, including improving standards for foreign language reading.\n\nThis fully-refereed journal is published twice a year, in April and October.  The editors seek manuscripts concerning both the practice and theory of learning to read and the teaching of reading in any foreign or second language.  Reviews of scholarly books and teaching materials, conference reports, and discussions are also solicited.  The language of the journal is English, but lexical citations of languages other than English are acceptable.

        "description": "<p>\nCollege and university foreign language (FL) programs are asked to engage in evaluation of many kinds and for many reasons, such as traditional program reviews and more recent accreditation pressures to assess student learning outcomes. In addition, particular programs have unique needs -- as an example, the assessment of student proficiency to evaluate foreign language programs has just been announced as a Title VI NRC competitive priority for FY 2006.  Often, however, evaluation within FL programs is perceived as an onerous bureaucratic task that is imposed from the outside. Distinctions between student assessment and program evaluation are poorly understood, as are the links between evaluation and the improvement of curriculum and instruction. This project is designed to help FL educators build their capacities to engage in evaluation for understanding, improving, and ensuring FL program quality across colleges and universities in the US. \n</p>\n<p>\nThe project is divided into three phases. Phase 1 focuses on identifying the primary uses and demands for evaluation in US college FL programs and on appraising current capacities to meet such demands. In Phase 2 the research team will develop strategies and resources, such as self-study modules, evaluation instrument templates, and workshops on evaluation procedures, that will be made available on the project web site in conjunction with a searchable database. In Phase 3 the developed strategies and resources will be field-tested, evaluated, and revised, via implementation in and close collaboration with five representative foreign language program sites. \n</p>\n<p>\nThis project is supported by a Title VI International Research and Studies (IRS) grant (2005-08), which supports the research and development aspects of the project.  The NFLRC will carry the primary responsibility for disseminating results, in the following ways:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>By hosting the <a href=\"http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/evaluation/\" target=\"blank\">project website</a> on the NFLRC server and providing technical support as needed;</li><li>\nBy co-sponsoring the annual Summer Seminar of the <a href=\"http://www.adfl.org/seminars/index.htm\" target=\"blank\">ADFL</a>, held at UH in June 2007, with a major strand of the conference dedicated to foreign language program evaluation;\n</li><li>By conducting the <a href=\"http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/get_prodev.cfm?institute_id=41\" target=\"blank\">Foreign Language Program Evaluation Summer Institute</a> in 2007, a workshop that was held immediately preceding the ADFL conference. Outreach efforts for the workshop targeted educators from across the US who represent less commonly-taught languages. In addition, a number of ADFL conference participants (typically heads of departments of the more commonly taught languages) also participated in the workshop;\n</li><li>By providing graduate assistant support to maintain the website and continue the development projects planned for the project in years 3 (2008-09) and 4 (2009-10) of the grant cycle, following the conclusion of the IRS grant; and\n</li><li>By publishing and disseminating all results from the project.  It is anticipated that this will include traditional media products such as technical reports and monographs as well as electronic publications.</li></ul>\n<p>\nAn additional benefit of this project is that it addresses the competitive priority that has been set for Title VI NRCs, to carry out \"activities designed to demonstrate the quality of the center's or program's language instruction through the measurement of student proficiency in the less and least commonly taught languages.\"  Although proficiency testing of students and program evaluation are not the same (the latter being the broader construct), the NFLRC supports this NRC priority by publicizing the summer institute on program evaluation to NRC directors and encouraging their participation.

In addition, particular programs have unique needs ? as an example, the assessment of student proficiency to evaluate foreign language programs has just been announced as a Title VI NRC competitive priority for FY 2006.  Often, however, evaluation within FL programs is perceived as an onerous bureaucratic task that is imposed from the outside. Distinctions between student assessment and program evaluation are poorly understood, as are the links between evaluation and the improvement of curriculum and instruction. This project is designed to help FL educators build their capacities to engage in evaluation for understanding, improving, and ensuring FL program quality across colleges and universities in the US. </p><p>\nThe project is divided into three phases. Phase 1 focuses on identifying the primary uses and demands for evaluation in US college FL programs and on appraising current capacities to meet such demands. In Phase 2 the research team will develop strategies and resources, such as self-study modules, evaluation instrument templates, and workshops on evaluation procedures, that will be made available on the project web site in conjunction with a searchable database. In Phase 3 the developed strategies and resources will be field-tested, evaluated, and revised, via implementation in and close collaboration with five representative foreign language program sites. </p><p>\nThis project is supported by a Title VI International Research and Studies (IRS) grant (2005-08), which supports the research and development aspects of the project.  The NFLRC will carry the primary responsibility for disseminating results, in the following ways:</p><ul>\n<li>By hosting the project website on the NFLRC server and providing technical support as needed;</li><li>\nBy co-sponsoring the annual Summer Seminar of the ADFL, to be held at UH in June 2007, with a major strand of the conference dedicated to foreign language program evaluation;\n</li><li>By conducting the Foreign Language Program Evaluation Summer Institute in 2007, a workshop that will be held immediately preceding or following the ADFL conference.

        "description": "<p>To address the LRC mandate for \u201cthe conduct and dissemination of research on new and improved methods for teaching foreign languages, including the use of advanced educational technology,\u201d NFLRC will build on previous work to initiate a new series of technology-based initiatives for advanced proficiency learners of priority languages. The project will be co-sponsored by UH Title VI centers (representing <a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/nrcea/\" target=\"blank\"> East Asia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cseashawaii.com/\" target=\"blank\"> Southeast Asia</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/\" target=\"blank\"> Pacific Islands</a>) or the <a href=\"http://www.shidler.hawaii.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=930\" target=\"blank\"> Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER)</a>. The basic model for all these online communities is the online language caf\u00e9, a place for people to gather for discussion, social interaction, language learning, and the development of intercultural competence. During the 2006-2010 grant period, NFLRC developed <a href=\"http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/onlinecafes/\" target=\"blank\"> prototype online caf\u00e9s</a> for heritage language learners, enabling students of Filipino, Japanese, and Samoan to come together online with students at distant locations to explore issues of interest while using the target language. A Chinese for international business caf\u00e9 was also created, enabling MBA students in the US to prepare for study abroad through cultural exchange with counterparts in China. These existing online language caf\u00e9s will be continued, and five new online learning communities will be developed, with others added later as opportunities and additional support become available.</p>\n\n<p>The facilitators (instructors) can integrate these virtual communities of practice, engaged in inquiry-based learning, into traditional face-to-face instruction. In online forums, students can create their own source material and construct new knowledge, but at the same time, interaction in the caf\u00e9s will be scaffolded to afford purposeful, task-based use of the target language to benefit the various groups of participants while socializing them in a target-language oriented community of practice. A description of each new project follows.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chinese, Korean, Russian Flagship Caf\u00e9s</b><br>In partnership with the NSEP <a href=\"http://www.thelanguageflagship.org/\" target=\"blank\">Language Flagship</a>  program, NFLRC will develop Chinese, Korean, and Russian Flagship Caf\u00e9s.  Online learning communities will join Flagship students at domestic sites and study abroad sites. The online communities will have quite flexible parameters. Joining students together online across sites will enable second-year students to act as mentors for first-year students. First-year students will likewise be able to better prepare for their upcoming international experience, further improving their language skills and networking. For example, Flagship students engaged in the process of acculturating to their new study and work environments in the target language environment will be able to \"blog\" their experiences in the target language for domestic Flagship students, using text, images, and sound or video, while domestic Flagship students will be able to use the caf\u00e9s to ask for firsthand reports on happenings on the ground in the target language environment. Information about the Flagship Caf\u00e9s will be disseminated by the participating institutions to the other national Flagship programs as a potential model for online communities in other critical languages.</p>\n\n<p><b>International Teacher Development Caf\u00e9 for Samoan Educators</b><br>In partnership with the UH Center for Pacific Islands Studies (CPIS, a Title VI NRC), NFLRC will create an International Teacher Development Caf\u00e9 for Samoan language educators. A Samoan diaspora spans the Pacific from California to Hawai\u2018i to Samoa to New Zealand. A Samoan Educators Caf\u00e9 will be created 1) to facilitate networking and the sharing of ideas, research, and materials among members of the Samoan Language Commission (an international organization whose mission is the enhancement of the teaching, learning, and speaking of Samoan) and 2) to assist them in creating their own Samoan heritage language caf\u00e9s for their students.</p>\n\n<p><b>Japanese for International Business Caf\u00e9</b><br>Building on the model of the existing Chinese for international business caf\u00e9, NFLRC will launch a Japanese for International Business Caf\u00e9, in partnership with NRCEA and the UH CIBER. The Japanese Caf\u00e9 project will enable MBA students conducting internships in Japan to engage in facilitated target-language conversations online throughout Japan. The Japanese Caf\u00e9 will serve as a virtual support group and networking venue for US business interns in Japan, where students may engage in facilitated discussions regarding issues relating to language, culture, and business practices. Information will be disseminated to the national network of CIBERs so that the project may serve as a prototype for creation of business caf\u00e9s in other languages.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vietnamese Study Abroad Caf\u00e9</b><br>In partnership with the UH Center for Southeast Asian Studies, NFLRC will launch a Vietnamese Study Abroad Caf\u00e9 for students of VASI (Vietnamese Advanced Summer Institute), an intensive course of advanced language study conducted for eight weeks in Ho Chi Minh City. VASI is funded by the U.S. Department of Education Fulbright-Hays Group Projects Abroad, and VASI students represent a consortium of eleven universities collectively referred to as the Group of Universities for the Advancement of Vietnamese Abroad (GUAVA). The Vietnamese Caf\u00e9 will serve as a virtual support group and networking venue for VASI participants.</p>\n\n\n<p><b>Future possibilities</b><br>The online learning communities described above will all be implemented in the 2010-2014 funding period. Additional caf\u00e9s may be added as opportunities arise and supplementary funding sources are found. It is possible that an online community for language evaluation and assessment specialists may be added later, and it is quite likely that as the model is disseminated, others will want to design and offer their own learning communities based on these models.</p>\n\n<p><b><a href=\"http://llc.manoa.hawaii.edu/brixdev\" target=\"blank\">BRIX Open-source Course Management System (CMS)</a></b><br>Online education has encompassed virtually every discipline in academic institutions. In the development of tools for online instruction, however, one size does not necessarily fit all; different disciplines may require specialized features in online learning environments not found in commercial CMSs such as Desire2Learn and Blackboard. Over the course of several LRC awards, NFLRC has developed its own course management system, BRIX, as a valuable tool for the foreign language teaching and learning community. BRIX features specific tools enabling online learning communities to co-construct word banks, communicate asynchronously via threaded discussions with voice recordings, and engage in multi-draft process writing with peer editing. Over the last decade, these customized features have facilitated the development of over 60 online courses or learning communities for language learning, teacher training, and intercultural exchange. BRIX will be disseminated to institutions participating in the new and continuing NFLRC language caf\u00e9s so that these institutions can, in turn, spin off and host their own online caf\u00e9s with new partners.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeline for implementation</b><br>In 2010-11, NFLRC will continue to support existing Filipino, Samoan, and Business Chinese online learning communities, while designing shells for all new caf\u00e9s. We will produce a training video on the model, conduct online orientation for caf\u00e9 facilitators and continue to add functionalities to the BRIX CMS. In Summer 2011 a major workshop will bring together faculty from participating sites to build their respective language-specific caf\u00e9s. At the NFLRC Summer Institute on \u201cOnline Learning Communities for LCTLs,\u201d offered for project partners, participants will structure thematic caf\u00e9 content rubrics, participate in training sessions on research-based pedagogical best practices for facilitating online learning communities, and receive orientation on the IT aspects of hosting the BRIX system.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011-2012 (Year Two), at least 4 academic-year language learner caf\u00e9s will be launched, joined shortly thereafter by learners in intensive summer programs.

The project will be co-sponsored by UH Title VI centers (representing <a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/nrcea/\" target=\"blank\"> East Asia</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cseashawaii.com/\" target=\"blank\"> Southeast Asia</a>, and the <a href=\"http://www.hawaii.edu/cpis/\" target=\"blank\"> Pacific Islands</a>) or the <a href=\"http://www.shidler.hawaii.edu/Default.aspx?tabid=930\" target=\"blank\"> Center for International Business Education and Research (CIBER)</a>. The basic model for all these online communities is the online language caf\u00e9, a place for people to gather for discussion, social interaction, language learning, and the development of intercultural competence. During the 2006-2010 grant period, NFLRC developed <a href=\"http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/onlinecafes/\" target=\"blank\"> prototype online caf\u00e9s</a> for heritage language learners, enabling students of Filipino, Japanese, and Samoan to come together online with students at distant locations to explore issues of interest while using the target language. A Chinese for international business caf\u00e9 was also created, enabling MBA students in the US to prepare for study abroad through cultural exchange with counterparts in China. These existing online language caf\u00e9s will be continued, and five new online learning communities will be developed, with others added later as opportunities and additional support become available.</p>\n\n<p>The facilitators (instructors) can integrate these virtual communities of practice, engaged in inquiry-based learning, into traditional face-to-face instruction. In online forums, students can create their own source material and construct new knowledge, but at the same time, interaction in the caf\u00e9s will be scaffolded to afford purposeful, task-based use of the target language to benefit the various groups of participants while socializing them in a target-language oriented community of practice. A description of each new project follows.</p>\n\n<p><b>Chinese, Korean, Russian Flagship Caf\u00e9s</b><br>In partnership with the NSEP <a href=\"http://www.thelanguageflagship.org/\" target=\"blank\">Language Flagship</a>  program, NFLRC will develop Chinese, Korean, and Russian Flagship Caf\u00e9s.  Online learning communities will join Flagship students at domestic sites and study abroad sites. The online communities will have quite flexible parameters. Joining students together online across sites will enable second-year students to act as mentors for first-year students. First-year students will likewise be able to better prepare for their upcoming international experience, further improving their language skills and networking. For example, Flagship students engaged in the process of acculturating to their new study and work environments in the target language environment will be able to \"blog\" their experiences in the target language for domestic Flagship students, using text, images, and sound or video, while domestic Flagship students will be able to use the caf\u00e9s to ask for firsthand reports on happenings on the ground in the target language environment. Information about the Flagship Caf\u00e9s will be disseminated by the participating institutions to the other national Flagship programs as a potential model for online communities in other critical languages.</p>\n\n<p><b>International Teacher Development Caf\u00e9 for Samoan Educators</b><br>In partnership with the UH Center for Pacific Islands Studies (CPIS, a Title VI NRC), NFLRC will create an International Teacher Development Caf\u00e9 for Samoan language educators. A Samoan diaspora spans the Pacific from California to Hawai\u2018i to Samoa to New Zealand. A Samoan Educators Caf\u00e9 will be created 1) to facilitate networking and the sharing of ideas, research, and materials among members of the Samoan Language Commission (an international organization whose mission is the enhancement of the teaching, learning, and speaking of Samoan) and 2) to assist them in creating their own Samoan heritage language caf\u00e9s for their students.</p>\n\n<p><b>Japanese for International Business Caf\u00e9</b><br>Building on the model of the existing Chinese for international business caf\u00e9, NFLRC will launch a Japanese for International Business Caf\u00e9, in partnership with NRCEA and the UH CIBER. The Japanese Caf\u00e9 project will enable MBA students conducting internships in Japan to engage in facilitated target-language conversations online throughout Japan. The Japanese Caf\u00e9 will serve as a virtual support group and networking venue for US business interns in Japan, where students may engage in facilitated discussions regarding issues relating to language, culture, and business practices. Information will be disseminated to the national network of CIBERs so that the project may serve as a prototype for creation of business caf\u00e9s in other languages.</p>\n\n<p><b>Vietnamese Study Abroad Caf\u00e9</b><br>In partnership with the UH Center for Southeast Asian Studies, NFLRC will launch a Vietnamese Study Abroad Caf\u00e9 for students of VASI (Vietnamese Advanced Summer Institute), an intensive course of advanced language study conducted for eight weeks in Ho Chi Minh City. VASI is funded by the U.S. Department of Education Fulbright-Hays Group Projects Abroad, and VASI students represent a consortium of eleven universities collectively referred to as the Group of Universities for the Advancement of Vietnamese Abroad (GUAVA). The Vietnamese Caf\u00e9 will serve as a virtual support group and networking venue for VASI participants.</p>\n\n<p><b>Future possibilities</b><br>The online learning communities described above will all be implemented in the 2010-2014 funding period. Additional caf\u00e9s may be added as opportunities arise and supplementary funding sources are found. It is possible that an online community for language evaluation and assessment specialists may be added later, and it is quite likely that as the model is disseminated, others will want to design and offer their own learning communities based on these models.</p>\n\n<p><b><a href=\"http://llc.manoa.hawaii.edu/brixdev\" target=\"blank\">BRIX Open-source Course Management System (CMS)</a></b><br>Online education has encompassed virtually every discipline in academic institutions. In the development of tools for online instruction, however, one size does not necessarily fit all; different disciplines may require specialized features in online learning environments not found in commercial CMSs such as Desire2Learn and Blackboard. Over the course of several LRC awards, NFLRC has developed its own course management system, BRIX, as a valuable tool for the foreign language teaching and learning community. BRIX features specific tools enabling online learning communities to co-construct word banks, communicate asynchronously via threaded discussions with voice recordings, and engage in multi-draft process writing with peer editing. Over the last decade, these customized features have facilitated the development of over 60 online courses or learning communities for language learning, teacher training, and intercultural exchange. BRIX will be disseminated to institutions participating in the new and continuing NFLRC language caf\u00e9s so that these institutions can, in turn, spin off and host their own online caf\u00e9s with new partners.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeline for implementation</b><br>In 2010-11, NFLRC will continue to support existing Filipino, Samoan, and Business Chinese online learning communities, while designing shells for all new caf\u00e9s. We will produce a training video on the model, conduct online orientation for caf\u00e9 facilitators and continue to add functionalities to the BRIX CMS. In Summer 2011 a major workshop will bring together faculty from participating sites to build their respective language-specific caf\u00e9s. At the NFLRC Summer Institute on \u201cOnline Learning Communities for LCTLs,\u201d offered for project partners, participants will structure thematic caf\u00e9 content rubrics, participate in training sessions on research-based pedagogical best practices for facilitating online learning communities, and receive orientation on the IT aspects of hosting the BRIX system.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011-2012 (Year Two), at least 4 academic-year language learner caf\u00e9s will be launched, joined shortly thereafter by learners in intensive summer programs. Each subsequent year, a minimum of 6 online learning communities will be offered (new or continuing). Additional innovations to the BRIX system will enhance its usefulness as both a research tool and a free open-source online course management tool for the profession at large. NFLRC also anticipates hosting the national Computer Assisted Language Instruction Consortium (CALICO) conference in Spring 2013, providing an ideal venue for disseminating project results thus far.</p>\n",

The participants were 64 students in first- and second-year Italian classes at the university level. Three tests were given to ascertain the students' ability to assign gender based on morphophonological, syntactic, and semantic cues. Results showed that the students were sensitive to cues in the word-final phonemes that reliably indicate gender, and implicational scaling demonstrated a clear order of difficulty among these endings. The students exhibited a low degree of awareness of the gender associations of certain derivational suffixes. When dealing with more than one cue, the students had no difficulty assigning gender when the cues were in accord, while coping with conflicting cues was more problematic. Nonetheless, in the majority of the cases, the students were able to use syntactic cues to override contradictory cues in the noun endings. While as a group, the students were reliant on a syntactic strategy, the implicational scaling performed on the results revealed the presence of subgroups following different strategies, i.e., morphophonological or semantic.

        "description": "Original Invitation to the Colloquium: \nAt a special colloquium at SLRF/Los Angeles in 1989, participants examined the so-called access question: Is Universal Grammar accessible to the (adult) L2 learner? Given that nearly ten years have passed since that colloquium, and given that we have, in that time, learned a good deal more about the nature of the human language faculty, it seems like a good time to reexamine the assumptions that went into the original UG-access research of the 1980s. In particular, then, questions that participants at the present colloquium might consider include (at least) the following: Is the original access question a reasonable one to ask at the present time? Does the current state of linguistic theory, our current understanding of the human language potential, warrant the original question? If not, how should the question be reformulated? How would such a reformulation affect our understanding of previous research, as well as any future attempts at falsification of a reformulated question?  \nAfter the colloquium, several members of the audience asked whether we had taped or videotaped the session. In fact, the idea had never dawned on any of us. In the days after the conference, we then discussed the feasibility of making the papers available as unpublished manuscripts on the web. Of course, because the manuscripts do not include the Q&A discussions that followed each and every presentation, making the papers web-accessible will not substitute entirely.

Original Invitation to the Colloquium: \nAt a special colloquium at SLRF/Los Angeles in 1989, participants examined the so-called access question: Is Universal Grammar accessible to the (adult) L2 learner? Given that nearly ten years have passed since that colloquium, and given that we have, in that time, learned a good deal more about the nature of the human language faculty, it seems like a good time to reexamine the assumptions that went into the original UG-access research of the 1980s. In particular, then, questions that participants at the present colloquium might consider include (at least) the following: Is the original access question a reasonable one to ask at the present time? Does the current state of linguistic theory, our current understanding of the human language potential, warrant the original question? If not, how should the question be reformulated? How would such a reformulation affect our understanding of previous research, as well as any future attempts at falsification of a reformulated question?  \nAfter the colloquium, several members of the audience asked whether we had taped or videotaped the session. In fact, the idea had never dawned on any of us. In the days after the conference, we then discussed the feasibility of making the papers available as unpublished manuscripts on the web. Of course, because the manuscripts do not include the Q&A discussions that followed each and every presentation, making the papers web-accessible will not substitute entirely. Nevertheless, we hope that the papers will at least stimulate further discussion of the issues.

        "description": "From the introduction...  The teaching of foreign languages (FLs) at the post-secondary level in the USA increasingly reflects an interest in developing communicative proficiency, but at many universities, courses for the training of university-level foreign language instructors may not fully reflect this change. One major problem is that the curriculum for degrees in foreign languages reflects a heavy concern with literature and/or the structural characteristics of language, with little attention to pedagogy or provision for future faculty development. Key to this continuing structure is the fact that \"probably less than 1% of the entire[foreign] language professoriate in the US is a specialist in applied linguistics related to language learning and teaching. In short, we have no large population of language educators at the Ph.D. level. University language departments are, by and large, departments of literature and culture.\" (Italics in original; VanPatten, 1998, p.931) One other major problem with more long-term implications is that FL teacher preparation programs, like teacher preparation programs generally, do not prepare the teacher to engage in a process of life-long learning, do not help teachers to use published research, and do not provide them with a problem-solving orientation to their own classroom teaching. Since, in addition, in the relationship between researchers and teachers, teachers are generally at the bottom of a top-down process, unable to provide adequate input into research operations (Berne, 1998), there is a real risk that the post-secondary level faculty who are trained today will remain static in their level of professionalism and use of pedagogy.

        "description": "FROM THE INTRODUCTION...\nAn increasing body of research examines the development of L2 learners' pragmatic ability (cf. reviews by Kasper & Schmidt, 1996; Bardovi-Harlig, 1999a; Kasper & Rose, 1999). While some earlier longitudinal studies chart observed acquisitional patterns descriptively without relating them to an explanatory framework of second language development (e.g., Ellis, 1992; Sawyer, 1992), other investigations are explicitly guided by - in the rare case, even designed to test - theoretical approaches to L2 learning. Since a fair amount of research under different theoretical orientations now exists, it is timely to take stock of what these approaches have contributed to our understanding of L2 pragmatic development and - not unlike the tenure process at some North American universities - assess their 'future value.'",

While some earlier longitudinal studies chart observed acquisitional patterns descriptively without relating them to an explanatory framework of second language development (e.g., Ellis, 1992; Sawyer, 1992), other investigations are explicitly guided by - in the rare case, even designed to test - theoretical approaches to L2 learning. Since a fair amount of research under different theoretical orientations now exists, it is timely to take stock of what these approaches have contributed to our understanding of L2 pragmatic development and - not unlike the tenure process at some North American universities - assess their 'future value.' nw19 network networks online 2000\nFRBIS",

Moving beyond Rampton's discussion, the careful examination of the relationship between the individual students and their study of Japanese provides a more accurate understanding of these concepts. The findings reveal that the students' language inheritance and affiliation, which are understood as their \"continuity\" with other Japanese Americans in Hawai`i and their \"connection\" to the language and culture in Japan respectively, have different significance for each student.

        "description": "The survey reported here is part of a larger project targetting placement practices in language programs. The overall goal of the project is to develop a manual of best practices in placement testing that would be of use to those people involved in the placement process. Although in one sense good testing practices transcend specific testing purposes and any training in test development would be useful for placement testing, we wanted to tailor the manual as much as possible to concerns and issues common in assessing language for placement decisions.

Norris, John McE. Davis, Castle Sinicrope, Yukiko Watanabe\nBrief overview of the volume (for the back cover):\nThis collection features innovative and useful evaluation work that is currently underway in a variety of college foreign language (FL) programs across the U.S. The purpose is to provide the U.S. FL community with good examples of the ways in which evaluation can inform, support, improve, and ensure the value of what we do in language education. An introductory chapter scopes out the territory for evaluation in college FL education, reporting on key findings from recent interview and survey research into the needs, concerns, impetuses, and uses for evaluation that FL educators identify. Collected chapters then report on evaluation case studies that have been conducted in diverse language programs and distinct institutional contexts (private and public institutions, small and large universities, and including Chinese, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish languages). Each case is reported by program-internal educators who took responsibility for meeting specific evaluation demands. The authors walk readers through the steps in evaluation projects that were designed in response to particular challenges and utilizing appropriate corresponding methods, with an ultimate focus on producing findings that are actually useful and used. The collection concludes with a chapter reflecting on the status of evaluation in college FL education and articulating an agenda with the ultimate goal of making evaluation part and parcel of language education practice.\nTable of Contents\nForeword: Introduction to the volume\nJohn M.

Since Manchu courses are only rarely taught at universities anywhere, this second edition includes audio recordings to assist students with the pronunciation of the texts. xlt03-2",

        "description": "FULL TITLE: Ideal Classmates and Reciprocal Idealizing through Critical Participatory Looping (CPL) in Socially Intelligent Dynamic Systems (SINDYS)<br>Tim Murphey describes an easy action research/activity done in the spring of 2012 with 488 students in four Tokyo area Japanese universities. It had a big impact on the students and could easily be replicated in other classrooms, in almost any school situation. Murphey\u2019s Tokyo research group asked students the following question: <br>\r\n#39 Please describe a group of classmates that you could learn English well with. What would you all do to help each other learn better and more enjoyably? <br>\r\nTheir answers were so interesting that the researchers first compiled them anonymously on a handout and gave them back to each class for discussion. Then the  488 comments were coded into 16 descriptors and looped back to the same students a month later to ask if these indeed were important, if their classmates were doing them, and if they were doing them. The positive results can be understood partially through the field of Appreciative Inquiry, emotional contagion (Hatfield, et al., 1994), the altruistic turn, dynamic systems theory, and critical participatory looping. Teachers will be given practical ideas for doing these and similar things in the classroom. In the meantime, Tim dares to ask you (and dares you to ask others!) \u201cWhat do people do to help you have a great day and a meaningful life?\u201d",

It counts among its members scholars, business people, diplomats, journalists, and interested lay persons.\n\nThe AAS was founded in 1941, originally as publisher of the Far Eastern Quarterly (now the Journal of Asian Studies). It has gone through a series of reorganizations to serve better the broadening disciplinary and geographical interests of its membership. In 1970 four elective area Councils\u2014South Asia (SAC), Southeast Asia (SEAC), China and Inner Asia (CIAC), and Northeast Asia (NEAC)\u2014were established to guarantee each area constituency its own representation and a proportionate voice on the Board of Directors. In 1977 a Council of Conferences (COC) was established as a liaison with several conferences throughout the United States which serve the needs of scholars of Asian studies in different parts of the country. The AAS is a member of the American Council of Learned Societies, actively participating with its sister societies in a wide range of activities, including joint participation in research, computerized abstracts and informational exchanges."

The \"Old French\" era covers the period from the year 842 (date of the \"Serments de Strasbourg\", the earliest known document written in the emerging vernacular) until about the year 1400 (the period when the 'two-case' system, which distinguished Old French from its modern, uninflected forms, began to disappear from the written language). \"Old French\" normally refers to the variety that developed in the North of France--Langue d'O\u00efl--which existed in numerous dialects and of which one--Francien--became the ancestor of modern standard French. However, the Southern dialect--Langue d'Oc--which exists today in a number of varieties collectively known as Occitan, must be considered, too; its linguistic, literary and cultural importance is inestimable. \n"

Therefore, to properly understand the origin, evolution and growth of\n      our languages, the political issues will also have to be studied well. To do this, one has to be not only a linguist but also, I believe, a politician\n      by trade. But I am not a politician. In view of this, I shall address the issue from a linguist\u2019s point of view.

        "description": "Heritage Language Education is fast becoming a field of its own, drawing from research and practice in linguistics, psychology, and language education. The first National Conference on Heritage Languages in Long Beach, CA in 2000 revealed that there is great deal of interest in but little understanding of the issues underlying the teaching and learning of heritage languages. The conference also addressed the lack of a research agenda and the dearth of instructional materials. The Long Beach conference was followed by a Research Priorities Conference at UCLA in 2001 that formulated a number of research directions. There is a demonstrable need for a forum for ongoing discussion among researchers and educators interested in heritage language acquisition. For more info check www.cal.org/heritage.\n\nTo meet such a need, we have established an online blind-refereed journal dedicated to these issues.\n\nIt is published jointly by the Language Resource Center of UCLA and the UC Consortium for Language Learning and Teaching and is housed on a server hosted by the UCLA International Institute at UCLA.\n\nWith the goal of advancing the knowledge about educating heritage speakers, the journal will seek submissions from researchers and practitioners in\n<UL><LI>linguistics & applied linguistics\n   <LI>psychology\n   <LI>sociology\n   <LI>language education\n   <LI>language policy and\n   <LI>other related and relevant fields\n</UL>"

When people listen to someone speak with a different accent from their own, they notice the difference, and they may even make certain biased social judgments about the speaker.\n\nThe speech accent archive is established to uniformly exhibit a large set of speech accents from a variety of language backgrounds. Native and non-native speakers of English all read the same English paragraph and are carefully recorded. The archive is constructed as a teaching tool and as a research tool. It is meant to be used by linguists as well as other people who simply wish to listen to and compare the accents of different english speakers. It allows users to compare the demographic and linguistic backgrounds of the speakers in order to determine which variables are key predictors of each accent. The speech accent archive demonstrates that accents are systematic rather than merely mistaken speech."

Norris, seeks to articulate useful program evaluation practices and resources with the actual needs of college foreign language (FL) educators, with an ultimate goal of building program evaluation capacity in U.S. college language education. Initial funding for the project was secured through a U.S. Department of Education, International Research and Studies grant, entitled \"Identifying and responding to evaluation needs in college foreign language programs.? In order to respond in maximally useful ways to the actual program evaluation needs of college FL educators, the project consists of three phases of work over the initial 3-year timeline (2005-2008). In Phase 1, needs analysis, we have utilized focus groups, interviews, and nationwide surveys to identify the priority demands and uses for evaluation across a variety of college FL program types. In Phase 2, resource development, we are producing strategies, models, examples, and tools to help educators respond to evaluation needs. In Phase 3, field-testing, we are pilot-testing and revising evaluation resources, and we are working intensively with several case study program sites across the U.S., in order to generate useful examples of evaluation at work in actual and diverse language program settings. Along the way, we are also actively disseminating evaluation resources and strategies, through presentations and publications, and through the hosting of events, workshops, and conferences, such as the ADFL Summer Seminar West in June 2007. Looking ahead, the UH National Foreign Language Resource Center will be contributing over its current funding cycle (until 2010) to the further impact of this project, by supporting long-term dissemination of resources to FL educators through workshops, web site hosting, publications, and other activities."

It is our hope that students will become enthusiastic about what they learn and continue documenting their language either with the LDTC or back home in their home communities. We also hope that they will share this knowledge with their communities demonstrating that they can play a dynamic role in the preservation, maintenance, and continuation of their languages. The commitment of one person can make all the difference.
