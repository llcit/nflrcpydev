Self-directed learning offers great potential for the extension of instructional resources, especially for the less commonly taught languages (LCTLs).

Nearly half of the 75 participants in the week-long Symposium on Local and Global Electronic Networking in Foreign Language Learning &amp; Research joined forces to present papers, conduct hands-on workshops, and facilitate discussion sessions. Although the workshops and symposium differed in scope and format, they all provided a forum by which educators could not only acquire and share resources, information, and ideas about current (and predicted) trends in technology for foreign language education but also had the opportunity to establish/maintain structures for communication and collaboration so that nationally coordinated work in specific areas of interest could continue beyond the Summer Institute.</p>\r\n<h4>WORKSHOP - June 26-30, 1995: Video Workshop</h4>\r\n<p>This workshop was a pedagogical, aesthetic, and technical introduction to video production in foreign language learning and teaching. Through a number of hands-on and experiential lessons as well as final group projects, participants learned the fundamental concepts and techniques of project development, audio and visual composition, and video editing. Considering a range of project types, from a single camera in the classroom to an on-location production with crew, various pedagogical approaches to enrich the students learning experience were examined. Special presentations by fellow NFLRC scholars from the mainland, a tour of the production studio, and visual thinking exercises in true paradise illustrated the potential and possibilities of this medium in foreign language instruction.<br /> Specific topics covered included:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Camera and tripod operation</li>\r\n<li>Storyboarding and scripting</li>\r\n<li>Pedagogical approaches for language instruction and learning</li>\r\n<li>Picture composition and staging &yen; Light and sound</li>\r\n<li>Sequencing and editing</li>\r\n<li>The interview, documentary, and montage opportunities for project oriented language instructors</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h4>PRE-SYMPOSIUM WORKSHOP - July 6-7, 1995</h4>\r\n<p>In this workshop, the following points were covered:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Introduction to electronic mail and file transfer using the pine mailing system and unix</li>\r\n<li>Using the Internet for communication via listserv mailing lists and USENET newsgroups</li>\r\n<li>Introduction to Internet tools including gopher, FTP, telnet, and World Wide Web</li>\r\n<li>As time permitted, an introduction to real time communication via IRC and MOOs.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These sessions were designed to bring participants up to par on basic and intermediate Internet skills for the following week's Networking Symposium.</p>\r\n<h4>SYMPOSIUM - July 10-14, 1995: Networking Symposium: Local &amp; Global Electronic Networking in Foreign Language Learning &amp; Research Advances in computer technology have created remarkable new ways to connect language learners - whether in a single classroom or across the globe.

Acknowledging the centrality of research on pragmatic development to the pedagogy of foreign languages, this NFLRC project focused on developmental aspects of pragmatic competence. During this research, it was found necessary to continue the exploration of some issues addressed in the previous grant period, viz. problems of research methodology and pragmatic norms.</p>\n\n<P><B>Pragmatic development</b></p>\n\n<P>The project examined three developmental issues which have been prominent in second language studies at large: the relationship between L2 proficiency and L1 transfer, the impact of socio-affective variables on interlanguage pragmatic development, and the teachability of pragmatic information (studies on further developmental issues are reported in Kasper (1996a)).</p>\n\n<P><I>Pragmatic transfer and proficiency</i></p>\n\n<P>In Maeshiba, Yoshinaga, Kasper, and Ross (1996), we examined the hypothesis advanced in the interlanguage pragmatics literature that (unlike in the acquisition of formal linguistic knowledge) more advanced learners transfer more of their L1 pragmatic knowledge\nbecause they have the formal means to do so. The test case for the study was the apology strategies chosen by Japanese ESL learners at different levels of proficiency. Since the choice of speech act realization strategies is constrained by context factors, we also probed into the relationship between sociopragmatic assessments of context and strategy transfer. The hypothesis of a positive correlation between (negative) pragmatic transfer and proficiency was\nnot supported: in pragmatics just like in other areas of interlanguage knowledge, negative L1 transfer decreases as L2 proficiency improves. Sociopragmatic assessments by native speakers\nwere highly predictive of positive transfer, whereas negative transfer of apology strategies occurred largely independent of context assessment. This suggests that negative pragmatic transfer may be due to other factors than sociopragmatic assessment, one possible candidate being learners' pragmalinguistic knowledge of conventions of means and form.</p>\n\n<P>Learners' pragmalinguistic assessment of form conventions was the focus of S. Takahashi's (1996) study on the transferability of conventionally indirect request strategies. While transferability has been a central question in research on lexical and syntactic\ntransfer, this study is the first to systematically examine the transferability of pragmatic knowledge and to develop a methodology for such research. Learners' transferability judgments were influenced by the degree of imposition and form of the request, whereas there was little effect of L2 proficiency on transferability ratings. The different outcomes of Maeshiba et al.' s and Takahashi's study suggest that the learning environment may play a central role in pragmatic development: participants in Maeshiba et al. were students in an ESL context, whereas Takahashi's participants were Japanese EFL students in Japan. The richer opportunities for input and productive language use in the ESL situation is likely to account\nfor the development observable in the ESL group but lacking in the EFL participants. For students to develop L2 pragmatic abilities in a foreign language context, it is crucial that FL instruction provides them with relevant input, raises their awareness about L2 pragmatics,\nand offers them opportunities for practice through different activities.</p>\n\n<P><I>Socio-affective variables</i></p>\n\n<P>Even though L2 learning is generally believed to be influenced by socio-affective variables, there have been less than a handful of studies to examine the impact of such variables on pragmatic development.

During this research, it was found necessary to continue the exploration of some issues addressed in the previous grant period, viz. problems of research methodology and pragmatic norms.</p>\n\n<P><B>Pragmatic development</b></p>\n\n<P>The project examined three developmental issues which have been prominent in second language studies at large: the relationship between L2 proficiency and L1 transfer, the impact of socio-affective variables on interlanguage pragmatic development, and the teachability of pragmatic information (studies on further developmental issues are reported in Kasper (1996a)).</p>\n\n<P><I>Pragmatic transfer and proficiency</i></p>\n\n<P>In Maeshiba, Yoshinaga, Kasper, and Ross (1996), we examined the hypothesis advanced in the interlanguage pragmatics literature that (unlike in the acquisition of formal linguistic knowledge) more advanced learners transfer more of their L1 pragmatic knowledge\nbecause they have the formal means to do so. The test case for the study was the apology strategies chosen by Japanese ESL learners at different levels of proficiency. Since the choice of speech act realization strategies is constrained by context factors, we also probed into the relationship between sociopragmatic assessments of context and strategy transfer. The hypothesis of a positive correlation between (negative) pragmatic transfer and proficiency was\nnot supported: in pragmatics just like in other areas of interlanguage knowledge, negative L1 transfer decreases as L2 proficiency improves. Sociopragmatic assessments by native speakers\nwere highly predictive of positive transfer, whereas negative transfer of apology strategies occurred largely independent of context assessment. This suggests that negative pragmatic transfer may be due to other factors than sociopragmatic assessment, one possible candidate being learners' pragmalinguistic knowledge of conventions of means and form.</p>\n\n<P>Learners' pragmalinguistic assessment of form conventions was the focus of S. Takahashi's (1996) study on the transferability of conventionally indirect request strategies. While transferability has been a central question in research on lexical and syntactic\ntransfer, this study is the first to systematically examine the transferability of pragmatic knowledge and to develop a methodology for such research. Learners' transferability judgments were influenced by the degree of imposition and form of the request, whereas there was little effect of L2 proficiency on transferability ratings. The different outcomes of Maeshiba et al.' s and Takahashi's study suggest that the learning environment may play a central role in pragmatic development: participants in Maeshiba et al. were students in an ESL context, whereas Takahashi's participants were Japanese EFL students in Japan. The richer opportunities for input and productive language use in the ESL situation is likely to account\nfor the development observable in the ESL group but lacking in the EFL participants. For students to develop L2 pragmatic abilities in a foreign language context, it is crucial that FL instruction provides them with relevant input, raises their awareness about L2 pragmatics,\nand offers them opportunities for practice through different activities.</p>\n\n<P><I>Socio-affective variables</i></p>\n\n<P>Even though L2 learning is generally believed to be influenced by socio-affective variables, there have been less than a handful of studies to examine the impact of such variables on pragmatic development.

This project attempts to address both of these issues.\n</P>\n\n<P>At the present time, prototypes are being developed and evaluated for various test formats in English, Korean and Japanese. These formats include both cued response and free response types for paper and pencil indirect measures, oral semi-direct measures, and self-assessment. Of primary concern is the consistency and validity of all of these measures. Various statistical methods for estimation of test reliability and decision dependability are applied. The focus\nis on the validation of the test instruments through a multi-method strategy examining the test methods with degree of control in response. The current validation study involves piloting, scoring, revising, and analysing the results of the English and Japanese versions. Each of the six assessment instruments will be administered to subjects in Hawai\u2018i and Japan.</P>\n\nTechnical Report outlining\nthe development process was published in 1992, and in 1995,\nTechnical Report including all\ninstruments in English was published.

The project's overall goal is two-pronged: improving the teaching of a particular foreign language, Indonesian, and developing approaches to the classroom learning of pragmatics which are applicable to other target languages as well. Indonesian is identified as the target language for this project because there are existing teaching materials which, although not primarily pragmatic in focus, the\nproject can build on, and because Indonesian is a typical foreign language in Hawai\u2018i, affording students little contact with the language outside the classroom.

Readily available corpora and easy-to-use tools can now be used on the spot in a language teaching context, by teachers and learners without extensive training in computational linguistics, and studies of linguistic features can be tailored to specific pedagogic context and learning requirements. Thus corpus linguistics fits in with the current emphasis on authentic materials and on task-based language teaching \u2014 emphases of other Hawai\u2018i NFLRC projects.\nThis NFLRC project, to be accomplished during the first two years of the grant cycle, will have limited aims.

Often, however, evaluation within FL education is perceived primarily as an onerous bureaucratic task that is imposed from the outside and lacking in any clear value for ensuring educational effectiveness or other valued program/project outcomes. Furthermore, distinctions between student assessment and program evaluation are poorly understood, as are the links between evaluation and the improvement of curriculum, instruction, and other aspects of program implementation. This project is designed to help FL educators build their capacities to engage in evaluation and assessment for understanding, improving, and ensuring FL program quality across US educational settings.</p>\n<p>This project leverages previous work co-sponsored under a Title VI International Research and Studies (IRS) grant (2005-08) and the 2006-2010 NFLRC grant, which identified evaluation needs expressed by tertiary FL educators, led to the development of a high-use website with extensive resources for FL program evaluation, included the training of a large number of FL program evaluators (in the 2007 NFLRC summer institute and through direct outreach), and resulted in the publication of numerous articles and an edited collection of case studies on program evaluation in college FL education.

First-year students will likewise be able to better prepare for their upcoming international experience, further improving their language skills and networking. For example, Flagship students engaged in the process of acculturating to their new study and work environments in the target language environment will be able to \"blog\" their experiences in the target language for domestic Flagship students, using text, images, and sound or video, while domestic Flagship students will be able to use the caf\u00e9s to ask for firsthand reports on happenings on the ground in the target language environment.

The Japanese Caf\u00e9 project will enable MBA students conducting internships in Japan to engage in facilitated target-language conversations online throughout Japan. The Japanese Caf\u00e9 will serve as a virtual support group and networking venue for US business interns in Japan, where students may engage in facilitated discussions regarding issues relating to language, culture, and business practices.

In the development of tools for online instruction, however, one size does not necessarily fit all; different disciplines may require specialized features in online learning environments not found in commercial CMSs such as Desire2Learn and Blackboard. Over the course of several LRC awards, NFLRC has developed its own course management system, BRIX, as a valuable tool for the foreign language teaching and learning community. BRIX features specific tools enabling online learning communities to co-construct word banks, communicate asynchronously via threaded discussions with voice recordings, and engage in multi-draft process writing with peer editing. Over the last decade, these customized features have facilitated the development of over 60 online courses or learning communities for language learning, teacher training, and intercultural exchange. BRIX will be disseminated to institutions participating in the new and continuing NFLRC language caf\u00e9s so that these institutions can, in turn, spin off and host their own online caf\u00e9s with new partners.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeline for implementation</b><br>In 2010-11, NFLRC will continue to support existing Filipino, Samoan, and Business Chinese online learning communities, while designing shells for all new caf\u00e9s. We will produce a training video on the model, conduct online orientation for caf\u00e9 facilitators and continue to add functionalities to the BRIX CMS. In Summer 2011 a major workshop will bring together faculty from participating sites to build their respective language-specific caf\u00e9s. At the NFLRC Summer Institute on \u201cOnline Learning Communities for LCTLs,\u201d offered for project partners, participants will structure thematic caf\u00e9 content rubrics, participate in training sessions on research-based pedagogical best practices for facilitating online learning communities, and receive orientation on the IT aspects of hosting the BRIX system.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011-2012 (Year Two), at least 4 academic-year language learner caf\u00e9s will be launched, joined shortly thereafter by learners in intensive summer programs. Each subsequent year, a minimum of 6 online learning communities will be offered (new or continuing). Additional innovations to the BRIX system will enhance its usefulness as both a research tool and a free open-source online course management tool for the profession at large.

It is possible that an online community for language evaluation and assessment specialists may be added later, and it is quite likely that as the model is disseminated, others will want to design and offer their own learning communities based on these models.</p>\n\n<p><b><a href=\"http://llc.manoa.hawaii.edu/brixdev\" target=\"blank\">BRIX Open-source Course Management System (CMS)</a></b><br>Online education has encompassed virtually every discipline in academic institutions. In the development of tools for online instruction, however, one size does not necessarily fit all; different disciplines may require specialized features in online learning environments not found in commercial CMSs such as Desire2Learn and Blackboard. Over the course of several LRC awards, NFLRC has developed its own course management system, BRIX, as a valuable tool for the foreign language teaching and learning community. BRIX features specific tools enabling online learning communities to co-construct word banks, communicate asynchronously via threaded discussions with voice recordings, and engage in multi-draft process writing with peer editing. Over the last decade, these customized features have facilitated the development of over 60 online courses or learning communities for language learning, teacher training, and intercultural exchange. BRIX will be disseminated to institutions participating in the new and continuing NFLRC language caf\u00e9s so that these institutions can, in turn, spin off and host their own online caf\u00e9s with new partners.</p>\n\n<p><b>Timeline for implementation</b><br>In 2010-11, NFLRC will continue to support existing Filipino, Samoan, and Business Chinese online learning communities, while designing shells for all new caf\u00e9s. We will produce a training video on the model, conduct online orientation for caf\u00e9 facilitators and continue to add functionalities to the BRIX CMS. In Summer 2011 a major workshop will bring together faculty from participating sites to build their respective language-specific caf\u00e9s. At the NFLRC Summer Institute on \u201cOnline Learning Communities for LCTLs,\u201d offered for project partners, participants will structure thematic caf\u00e9 content rubrics, participate in training sessions on research-based pedagogical best practices for facilitating online learning communities, and receive orientation on the IT aspects of hosting the BRIX system.</p>\n\n<p>In 2011-2012 (Year Two), at least 4 academic-year language learner caf\u00e9s will be launched, joined shortly thereafter by learners in intensive summer programs. Each subsequent year, a minimum of 6 online learning communities will be offered (new or continuing). Additional innovations to the BRIX system will enhance its usefulness as both a research tool and a free open-source online course management tool for the profession at large. NFLRC also anticipates hosting the national Computer Assisted Language Instruction Consortium (CALICO) conference in Spring 2013, providing an ideal venue for disseminating project results thus far.</p>\n", "image": null, "headline_tag": ""}}, {"pk": 52, "model": "nflrcapp.project", "fields": {"status": "Completed", "description": "The NFLRC has carried out numerous research projects during the decade and a half of its existence concerning the pragmatic aspects of second language use and learning, the most recent of these (in the 2002-2006 grant cycle) an investigation of Conversation Analysis as an approach to SLA research.

ABSTRACT\nFirst-rate placement procedures are important for effective teaching and learning in any language program because they help create classes that are relatively homogeneous in terms of the language proficiency of the students.  The main purpose of this study was to investigate how effectively and efficiently the current norm-referenced Japanese Placement Test (JPT) battery for the Japanese language program (three multiple-choice tests and essay test) at UHM separates the incoming students of Japanese into different course levels.  The XCalibretm computer software program (Assessment Systems, 1997) was used to estimate the discrimination, difficulty, and guessing parameters for each item on each multiple-choice test.  Based on these IRT analyses, we were able to suggest that all three multiple-choice tests be reduced in length while maintaining the same, if not better, level of reliability.  Additional analyses of the interrater reliability of the essay tests using the Spearman-Brown prophecy formula led us to suggest that the essay test might be made more efficient by using two raters instead of three.

PRAGMATICS & LANGUAGE LEARNING, a refereed series sponsored by the sponsored by the National Foreign Language Resource Center at the University of Hawai?i, publishes selected papers from the biannual International Pragmatics & Language Learning Conference under the editorship of the conference hosts. Check the NFLRC website for upcoming IPLL conferences and PLL volumes.</p><p>This volume features cutting-edge theoretical and empirical research on pragmatics and language learning among a wide-variety of learners in diverse learning contexts from a variety of language backgrounds (English, German, Japanese, Persian, and Spanish) and target languages (English, German, Japanese, Kiswahili, and Spanish). This collection of papers from researchers around the world includes critical appraisals on the role of formulas in interlanguage pragmatics and speech-act research from a conversation-analytic perspective.

Norris, John McE. Davis, Castle Sinicrope, Yukiko Watanabe\nBrief overview of the volume (for the back cover):\nThis collection features innovative and useful evaluation work that is currently underway in a variety of college foreign language (FL) programs across the U.S. The purpose is to provide the U.S. FL community with good examples of the ways in which evaluation can inform, support, improve, and ensure the value of what we do in language education. An introductory chapter scopes out the territory for evaluation in college FL education, reporting on key findings from recent interview and survey research into the needs, concerns, impetuses, and uses for evaluation that FL educators identify. Collected chapters then report on evaluation case studies that have been conducted in diverse language programs and distinct institutional contexts (private and public institutions, small and large universities, and including Chinese, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish languages). Each case is reported by program-internal educators who took responsibility for meeting specific evaluation demands. The authors walk readers through the steps in evaluation projects that were designed in response to particular challenges and utilizing appropriate corresponding methods, with an ultimate focus on producing findings that are actually useful and used. The collection concludes with a chapter reflecting on the status of evaluation in college FL education and articulating an agenda with the ultimate goal of making evaluation part and parcel of language education practice.\nTable of Contents\nForeword: Introduction to the volume\nJohn M.

It had a big impact on the students and could easily be replicated in other classrooms, in almost any school situation. Murphey\u2019s Tokyo research group asked students the following question: <br>\n#39 Please describe a group of classmates that you could learn English well with. What would you all do to help each other learn better and more enjoyably? <br>\nTheir answers were so interesting that the researchers first compiled them anonymously on a handout and gave them back to each class for discussion. Then the  488 comments were coded into 16 descriptors and looped back to the same students a month later to ask if these indeed were important, if their classmates were doing them, and if they were doing them. The positive results can be understood partially through the field of Appreciative Inquiry, emotional contagion (Hatfield, et al., 1994), the altruistic turn, dynamic systems theory, and critical participatory looping. Teachers will be given practical ideas for doing these and similar things in the classroom.
